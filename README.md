<h1>Save Animals</h1>
Save The Animals is a solution concept revolving around the depleting flora and fauna. We need to raise the voice for these voiceless beings around us because it is our actions that can make a change.

<h2>Our Motive</h2>

Over a million species of animal and plant life are now threatened with dying out- more than ever before in human history, according to the International Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. There has been an average 68% drop in global population sizes of amphibians, birds, fish mammals and reptiles between 1970 and 2016, according to the WWF's Living Planet Report 2020. Species are dying off 1,000 times more frequently today than during the 60 million years before the arrival of humans, according to a 2014 study by Brown University in the US. The report reinforces the “urgency to conserve what is left”, said lead author Jurriaan de Vos.

The platform provides an ideal space to spread awareness about the topic while garnering volunteers from around the world. Website also serves as a medium for donation collection for the cause, which in turn can be used for the betterment of our environment.


<h2>How we built it</h2>
The site uses the HTML, CSS, React, Bootstrap, Express.

<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>
The whole process has been a learning curve. I had to learn a few new stacks to integrate the features I wanted, while working on the time crunch. 


<h2>What's next for Save The Animals</h2>
The next motto of the Save The Animals is to include a merchandise shop in the next version, while including live nature boxes to make the audience more aware about the species around them.
